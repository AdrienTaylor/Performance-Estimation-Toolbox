----- Setup

In order to use the code, you should have YALMIP installed, along with some semidefinite solver (e.g. Mosek, Sedumi, SDPT3, ...).

Once YALMIP and the SDP solver installed (type 'yalmiptest' for checking the installation went fine); the toolbox can simply be installed
by executing the 'Install_PET' script (which only adds the required folders to your Matlab paths).
You can now execute the demo files for a step by step introduction to the toolbox.

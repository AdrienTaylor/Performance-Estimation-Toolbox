----- Introduction

(1) The document "PESTO_CDC2017_FINAL.pdf" contains the reference paper for the toolbox ("Performance Estimation Toolbox (PESTO): automated worst-case analysis of first-order optimization methods").
This paper contains a simplified and quick general introduction to the theory underlying the toolbox, and to its use.

If you used the toolbox, and found it useful for your research, you can mention the toolbox by citing this paper;
Taylor, Adrien B., Julien M. Hendrickx, and Fran√ßois Glineur. "Performance Estimation Toolbox (PESTO): automated worst-case analysis of first-order optimization methods." Proceedings of the 56th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2017). 2017.

(2) The document "UserGuide.pdf" contains more information and examples about the use of the toolbox.


----- Setup

In order to use the code, you should have YALMIP installed, along with some semidefinite solver (e.g. Mosek, Sedumi, SDPT3, ...).

Once YALMIP and the SDP solver installed (type 'yalmiptest' for checking the installation went fine); the toolbox can simply be installed by executing the 'Install_PESTO' script (which only adds the required folders to your Matlab paths).
You can now execute the demo files for a step by step introduction to the toolbox.

----- Approach

The toolbox implements the performance estimation approach as developped in the following articles:
 - "Smooth strongly convex interpolation and exact worst-case performance of first-order methods" (in Mathematical Programming).
 - "Exact Worst-case Performance of First-order Methods for Composite Convex Optimization" (in SIAM Journal on Optimization).
 
 Note that the approach of using semidefinite programming for obtaining worst-case guarantees was originally introduced in
 - Drori, Yoel, and Marc Teboulle. "Performance of first-order methods for smooth convex minimization: a novel approach." Mathematical Programming 145.1-2 (2014): 451-482.
